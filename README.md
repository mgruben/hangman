# hangman
A CLI implementation of the classic hangman game

This project was completed for the edX MIT 6.00.1x Intro to Python course.

If you're in that class right now, obey all honor code requirements before viewing this code.  
I recommend that this code should only be viewed _after_ you've completed your own implementation.  
If you're super stuck, take a break, take a walk, and it will come to you; good luck.
